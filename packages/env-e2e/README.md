# Env-e2e Flow package

Ephemeral, fully internal docker-compose environment + Playwright e2e as
**readiness evidence**. One `check` node owns the whole env lifecycle
atomically — up → seed → test → capture → down — with teardown guaranteed by a
shell trap on every exit path. A red suite drives a bounded fix loop; loop
exhaustion escalates to a human reviewer with the red report; **`pass` is the
only path to `done`** — the flow never auto-ships a red suite.

Normative SSOT: [design spec](../../docs/env-e2e/specs/2026-07-31-env-e2e-design.md).
This README summarizes and links the spec — it never forks it.

## Contracts (summary — spec §§2-6 are normative)

- **Exit-0 protocol.** `scripts/run-e2e.sh` exits `0` whenever the runner
  service executed (tests ran) — the verdict travels in the result JSON
  (`verdict: pass|fail`) and routes the graph via `decide`. Non-zero exit is
  reserved for `config`/`env` failure classes and fails the run (check nodes
  have no failure transition — rework cannot fix a broken env). Docker-level
  runner failures (reserved codes 125/126/127, or a trailing
  `Error response from daemon:` marker — compose flattens CLI errors to
  exit 1) are classified `env`, never a verdict.
- **Engine floor.** `compat.engine_min: 3.3.0` — the packaged script is
  executed from the installed revision via `MAISTER_FLOW_DIR` (platform
  ADR-154). On an older engine the command's
  `${MAISTER_FLOW_DIR:?…}` guard fails with an actionable one-liner.
- **Web-tier Docker.** `cli`/`check` nodes execute on the MAIster **web
  tier**: the Docker daemon + compose v2 must live there. Launch preflight
  (`requirements`) probes `docker info` and `docker compose version` before
  any worktree/session/token spend — host invariants only: the config file
  is deliberately NOT probed (probes run against the default-branch
  checkout; a branch adding it would be wrongly refused) and is validated
  in-run at the tested revision instead.
- **Timeout budget.** The e2e node declares `settings.timeoutMs: 900000`
  (15 min), clamped by the host ceiling `MAISTER_MAX_CLI_TIMEOUT_MS`
  (default 1 h). On timeout the engine SIGTERMs the whole process group; the
  trap has a 30 s grace to tear the env down.
- **Artifacts land in the run dir.** `e2e-report.tar.gz` (Playwright
  `playwright-report/` + `test-results/` + full runner log) and
  `e2e-compose-logs.txt`, re-produced on **every** attempt;
  `requiredFor: [review, merge]` currency on the report is the promotion
  gate.
- **Rework feedback.** The failing block is the `e2e_comments` field of the
  result JSON — injected into the next `implement` attempt
  (`rework.commentsVar`), bounded by `maxLoops: 3`, then `onExhaustion`
  escalation to the `review` human node (`resetTargets: [e2e]` grants a
  fresh budget per human-approved round).
- **Isolation — enforced.** Every compose invocation uses
  `-p maister-run-<runId>`; the config phase renders the resolved compose
  model and refuses (config class) published ports, `container_name:` pins,
  and `network_mode: host` — the runner reaches services by compose-network
  DNS only.
- **Sanitized env.** Every docker invocation runs under
  `env -i PATH HOME COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME + E2E_ENV` — defense-in-depth over
  the platform's ADR-153 allow-list. `DOCKER_HOST` is deliberately not
  propagated; use a docker context (`$HOME/.docker`) for non-default sockets.

## Per-project config — `.maister-env-e2e.sh` (repo root, sourced bash)

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `E2E_COMPOSE_FILES` | yes | Bash array of repo-relative compose files; `-f` merge order = array order. |
| `E2E_RUNNER_SERVICE` | yes | Compose service (profile `e2e`) that runs Playwright. |
| `E2E_WAIT_TIMEOUT` | no (120) | Seconds for `up --wait`. |
| `E2E_SEED_COMMAND` | no | Host `bash -c` hook after up, before tests (`$E2E_COMPOSE` prefix var available). |
| `E2E_ENV` | no | `NAME=VALUE` pairs for compose interpolation + the runner container (`-e`). |

Missing/invalid config → actionable `[env-e2e:config] …` failure before any
compose resource exists.

## Orphan sweep (crash-only cases)

Teardown is trap-guaranteed; only a SIGKILL-class death (grace exceeded,
> 4 MiB combined step output, hard web-process crash) can strand an env.
**Active runs use the same `maister-run-` prefix** — the listing commands are
discovery only; before tearing an id down, verify that run is terminal
(Crashed/Failed/Done) on the MAIster board. Never run a prefix-wide down.

```bash
docker compose ls | grep maister-run-        # discovery: stranded projects
docker ps --filter "name=maister-run-"       # discovery: stranded containers
# for a SPECIFIC id whose run is confirmed terminal in MAIster:
docker compose -p maister-run-<id> down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

## Requirements

- **Web-tier Docker socket**: `cli`/`check` nodes execute on the MAIster web
  tier — the Docker daemon + compose v2 must live on that host. The flow's
  `requirements` probes (`docker info`, `docker compose version`) refuse
  launch actionably before any worktree/session/token spend; the config file
  is validated in-run at the tested revision (not probed — probes see only
  the default branch).
- **Engine ≥ 3.3.0** (`MAISTER_FLOW_DIR`, platform ADR-154). Older engines
  fail at the command's `${MAISTER_FLOW_DIR:?…}` guard with a one-line
  remediation.
- **Timeout budget**: the node declares 900 s; the host ceiling is
  `MAISTER_MAX_CLI_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 1 h). On deployments predating the
  timeoutMs wiring the default 300 s applies — the fixture fits it; size
  your project's suite (or raise the ceiling) accordingly.
- **Image pre-pull**: run `examples/bootstrap-fixture.sh` (or pre-pull your
  stack's images) so the first run's `up --wait` fits the budget.
- **npm egress**: the runner performs `npm ci` — "fully internal" means zero
  **published ports**, not zero network egress.

## Fixture walkthrough

```bash
packages/env-e2e/examples/bootstrap-fixture.sh /path/to/fx-green
packages/env-e2e/examples/bootstrap-fixture.sh --red /path/to/fx-red
```

Each bootstrap refuses a non-empty target, copies the fixture (healthchecked
nginx `web` + postgres `db`, Playwright runner under compose profile `e2e`,
committed lockfile pinned to the runner image version, green `home.spec.ts` +
toggleable `red.spec.ts`), writes `maister.yaml` + `.maister-env-e2e.sh`
(`--red` appends `E2E_ENV=(FIXTURE_RED=1)`), git-inits, pre-pulls images, and
prints the registration steps. Green ends done-side; red exercises
fail → rework → converge/escalate. Running green + red simultaneously is the
concurrency proof (distinct `maister-run-*` compose projects).
