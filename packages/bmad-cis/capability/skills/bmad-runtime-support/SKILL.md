# BMAD runtime support

This is an internal package skill. Run `prepare.sh <project-slug>` from the
project root before invoking another vendored CIS skill. It installs the
version-matched customization resolver under `_bmad/scripts/` and creates the
package's default configuration only when the project has not supplied it.
